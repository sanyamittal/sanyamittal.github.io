# 2. Additive Manufacturing Workflows
3D printing software stands at the intersection of creativity and technology, acting as the bridge that converts digital designs into the language of 3D printers. These programs vary widely, catering to different phases of the 3D printing process—ranging from Design & Modeling (CAD) Software, Slicing (Print Preparation) Software, to STL editor and Repair Software, Print Management (Host) Software and Business Integrations. Each type serves a unique function, from crafting intricate designs to translating them into print-ready files, embodying the diverse capabilities required to bring 3D creations to life but for most AM production applications, the 3d printing process will look something like this:

1. **Design the part:** Design may mean modifying an existing design for 3D printing or starting from scratch with a true design for additive manufacturing (DFAM) mindset. Computer simulation, generative design and topology optimization can all be applied to optimize the function of the part. Printing process and material selection usually occurs in the initial design step.

|   Scan                       |   It’s the process of scanning a physical object and inputting the data into CAD software. Teams can then either manipulate the data itself to turn it into a new product or create a new product that fits within the data’s environment.                                                                                                                                                                 |   Autodesk Fusion 360        |
|   Data Modeling              |   Data modeling software creates a visual representation of an object to communicate connections between data points and structures. The software also includes features like smart labelling.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |   AutoCAD, UltiMaker         |
|   Data Exchange/Translation  |   3D CAD translation is the process of exporting or converting a native CAD file format (CATIA, Creo, SolidWorks, Inventor, etc.) to a neutral CAD file format (IGES, STEP, QIF, etc.). The objective is to have a compatible CAD file format for downstream use in other CAD, CAE, CAM, and CMM programs. While maintaining two identical models in geometry, 3D annotations, volume, surface area, etc.  |   Dassault Systems, AutoCAD  |
|   Slicing                    |   A slicer is a toolpath generation software used in 3D printing. It facilitates the conversion of a 3D object model to specific instructions for the printer. The slicer converts a model in STL (stereolithography) format into printer commands in G-code format.                                                                                                                                       |   UltiMaker, Aibuild         |

2. **Plan the build:** Depending on the intended 3D printing technology, this step may entail selecting part orientation, adding support structures, optimizing job files before printing, packing or nesting multiple parts together, and setting printer parameters such as layer height, laser spot size, feed rate, etc.

|   Software                    |   Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |   Major Players        |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
|   Orientation                 |   Orientation plays a vital role in the final product of 3d printing as it affects the part accuracy, manufacturing time, strength and surface finish. There is various orientations by which we can print the object vertically upward, vertically downward and in horizontal plane.                                                                               |   Autodesk Fusion 360  |
|   Adding support structures   |   Support structures are required where the objects are unable to be printed directly. Support structures help to guarantee the printability of a section during the 3D printing measure, and it can assist with forestalling part twisting, secure a section to the printing bed and guarantee that parts are joined to the fundamental body of the printed part.  |   Autodesk Fusion 360  |
|   Setting printer parameters  |   Editable print parameters that include liquefier temperature, oven temperature, bead mode options, UV exposure, head temperature, movement parameters, scaling, laser power and speed and more.                                                                                                                                                                   |   Stratasys            |
|   Material Selection          |   A handy tool that helps to narrow down and choose the best fit materials by sorting and filtering the available materials by characteristic or mechanical properties.                                                                                                                                                                                             |   Stratasys            |
|   Per Part Estimation         |   On a tray of 30 individual models, instead of one grouped time estimation, 30 separated estimations are generated, with a single click. Resulting in greater programming efficiency by reducing prep time on 3D printing.                                                                                                                                         |   Stratasys            |

3. **3D print the part:** A 3D printing build might take anywhere from minutes to days.

|   Software                      |   Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |   Major Players           |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
|   Fleet Management              |   Simplify how you manage a fleet of 3D printers and a group of users with advanced fleet management. Multiple users can add, duplicate and prioritize prints at any time across a fleet of 3D printers, wherever they may be.  |   FormLabs                |

|   Factory Integration           |   Streamline end-to-end AM workflows while automating tasks and integrating with business systems (i.e.: ERP, PLM, MES) and other third-party software and hardware.                                                            |   Materialise, Stratasys  |

4. **Postprocess the part:** Depending on the process, postprocessing could entail unpacking powder, prying or cutting parts from a build platform, cleaning, curing, heat treating, hot isostatic pressing (HIPping), etc.
5. **Finish the part:** Many 3D printed tools and production parts will require further finishing to arrive at their completed state. Finishing steps might include machining surfaces, drilling or tapping holes, dyeing, coating or painting, and possibly welding or assembly with other parts.
6. **Inspect the part:** Some parts can be evaluated with CMM measurement or 3D scanning; those with complex internal features may require X-ray or CT scanning. Different parts and applications may call for fewer or more steps. A hand tool made with fused filament fabrication (FFF) may not require any additional postprocessing once removed from the build plate. Parts with particularly stringent requirements, however, may require many more steps.

**Material Selection Process:** Material Selection criteria are generally the same as in conventional manufacturing:  
- Available on the market
- Fulfil MI criteria and requirements to lifetime of the components
- Ability to pass through the postprocessing treatment (any types of heat treatment, machining, coating with bond coat and TBC) without unexpected defects of behavior (like some materials might reveal cracks after HIP or have insufficient oxidation resistance at the harsh hot gas flow).

**Outcome:**
1. Improved design and greater precision as the pilot-gas feed isn’t mounted outside as a separate pipe but is now a part of the printed burner. This allows the operating temperature to be kept lower which in turn, lowers dynamic load at the same output, and the turbine is subjected to less stress – all of which extends the component’s lifespan and ultimately durability of the turbines.
2. More sustainable because it uses up to two-thirds less material.
3. Shorter supply chain as each burner is manufactured in one piece whereas they used to require 13 individual parts and 18 welds
4. Reduced error tolerance during production so production problems are less likely which means that the parts are more similar, and one can exchange them without having to tune the whole combustion mechanism anew making it a 'plug & play' process.
5. Even if there were anomalies they would be immediately noticed. For example, temperature sensors on the burners constantly provide feedback on their current status.
