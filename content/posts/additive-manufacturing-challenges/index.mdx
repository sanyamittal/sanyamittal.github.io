# 1. Research Question
What are the challenges in the industrialization of additive manufacturing? Can IT products be developed to overcome
those challenges?

# 2. What is Additive Manufacturing
Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing is the manufacturing of a three-dimensional object. The object is first
designed and simulated as a digital 3D model in CAD software and then printed in a printer. This printing is done in a
variety of processes in which material is either deposited, joined or solidified, typically layer by layer, under computer
control. Also, there are a variety of materials used to build objects such as plastics, liquids or metal powder grains. 3D
printing is the most common term in the consumer markets, while AM is mostly used in the industrial markets.
Though, the advent of 3D printing has revolutionized the manufacturing industry in many ways and the technology has
infiltrated almost every workshop across the world, it is still the case that casting, fabrication, stamping, and machining are
more prevalent than additive manufacturing. Since the AM technology is still in its nascent stage as compared to
conventional manufacturing methods, it is marred with challenges which bars the adoption of the technology for full
volume applications and is limited to prototype building.

# 3. AM Ecosystem

The additive manufacturing ecosystem is a complex interconnected network of entities involved in the AM process. This ecosystem is made up of several key components:
1. **Hardware:** This includes the 3D printers themselves, which use various technologies such as stereolithography
and selective laser sintering.
2. **Software:** Software tools, such as CAD and slicing software, are integral to the 3D printing process. They help
with designing the model and preparing it for printing.
3. **Materials:** A variety of materials like polymers, metals, ceramics, etc., are used in additive manufacturing.
4. **Post-processing Systems:** These systems are used after the printing process for finishing the printed parts.
5. **Research Institutions:** Institutes of national importance such as IITs, NITs, RRCAT, ISRO, BARC, and others have shown significant progress in R&amp;D and contribute significantly to the development of new technologies and startups in the field of additive manufacturing. The ecosystem is also supported by government initiatives, technological advancements, and interest from various
industries.

**Key Players in Additive Manufacturing:** The additive manufacturing ecosystem includes numerous key players, ranging from companies providing hardware, software, and materials to those offering specialized services. These companies are driving innovation and growth in the additive manufacturing industry. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list and there are many other players in each component of the AM ecosystem. The key players listed here are some of the prominent ones in their respective fields.

# 4. Types of Additive Manufacturing
There are many kinds of additive manufacturing technologies used today based on the following factors:
i. the way layers are deposited to create parts.
ii. the type of materials used.
Each process has its own advantages and drawbacks hence the main considerations in choosing an AM process are
generally specific application and requirements, speed and costs of the 3D printer, cost of the printed prototype and of
the materials, and color capabilities. Some of the most common AM processes include:

| AM Process                 | Method                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Technology                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sheet Lamination           | This method uses sheets of material (metal orplastics) that are bonded together layer by layer using welding or adhesive. The desired shape is cut by a laser or blade.                                                                               | Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM), Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM)                                    |
| Extrusion Deposition       | This technology uses a thermoplastic polymer such as ABS, PLA, PETG, and PEI, in the form of filament, that is melted and extruded through a nozzle to create a 3D object layer by layer.

# 5. Applications
Industrial Use Cases:
i. **Medical Industry:** In November 2021 a British patient named Steve Verze received the world&#39;s first fully 3D-printed prosthetic eye from the Moorfield&#39;s Eye Hospital in London.
ii. **Aerospace Industry:** One example of AM integration with aerospace was in 2016 when GE (General Electric) started integrating 3D printed fuel nozzles into its LEAP engines, reducing parts from 20 to 1, a 25% weight reduction, and reduced assembly times. Similarly, in 2015, PW (Pratt and Whitney) delivered their first AM parts in the PurePower PW1500G to Bombardier. Sticking to low-stress, non-rotating parts, PW selected the compressor stators and synch ring brackets to roll out this new manufacturing technology for the first time.


# 6. Challenges for the Industrialization of AM
1. **Size limitations:** The current inability to manufacture large and odd-sized parts is one of the biggest challenges of additive manufacturing. According to Deloitte, additive manufacturing especially underperforms, compared to traditional manufacturing, when it comes to the production of certain large aircraft components. Several AM providers and research institutes are already working on addressing this challenge, among these, UK company BAE systems, who used AM to manufacture a 1.2-meter titanium wingspear in collaboration with Cranfield University.
2. **Workforce Shortage:** Another challenge is the technical expertise required to manage and operate the equipment. That expertise may have to be developed internally with outside training, which is a slow process when attempting to justify capital equipment. File conversions and equipment expertise are only a portion of the labor requirements. Depending upon the technology, an operator may need to be on hand to swap filaments mid-print, adjust the settings, remove any support structures, and perform any post-processing operations.
3. **Slow Production Speeds:** 3D printing is known for slower manufacturing speeds, preventing the technology from high-scale production applications. Equipment manufacturers understand this shortcoming and are diligently looking at methods to improve production speeds. Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) printers have adopted two print heads to sinter powder faster. Other printer prototypes can reportedly print thirty layers simultaneously rather than one.
4. **Post Processing Tasks:** Most 3D printed parts require some form of post-processing to achieve the desired technical attributes and finish. While AM allows for complex designs, the post-processing of parts requires additional labor which makes it time–consuming and contributes to overhead costs per unit. Few examples of the most common post-processing tasks include support removal, resin removal, sanding, polishing and painting, vapor smoothing and curing. The challenge is to automate these operations with robotics and automated material handling systems. Though there has been a little technological development from companies like PostProcess which use SVC technology, based on principles of heat &amp; fluid flow, for support and resin removal, there is a
long way to achieve automation of all the post-processing tasks. Further, design for additive manufacturing (DFAM) is a useful tool in reducing the amount of post-processing needed for additively manufactured parts.
5. **Software:** There are limited capabilities in data preparation and design as an array of software is required, like CAD, Slicers, file conversion software. This raises the need for all-encompassing software which can provide all the digital capabilities from design to workflow management. The result is that the industry has been developing workflow management software specifically for 3D printing. This software aids in managing the workflow, including requests, printability analysis, machine analytics, production scheduling, post-processing management,
and supplier communication.
6. **Quality:** Additive manufacturing faces certain challenges with quality consistency, especially in producing fully dense metal parts where the part-to-part variation, non-uniform strength in the plane of layers, and contamination of material are major concerns. Some of this is material related, while improper storage and handling is another aspect. Standardized testing is needed to ensure material and handling quality. Since, inline quality control is still relatively new to AM technologies, the ability to monitor the build in real-time with cameras and sensors embedded inside a 3D printer will allow the shift from an open-loop to a closed-loop control system which will contribute to consistent geometries, material properties, and surface finishes of superior
quality.
7. **Narrow range of materials:** Currently, additive manufacturing technology generally uses a small group of polymers and metal powders to produce parts. These are costly materials with much higher price tags than the materials used in traditional manufacturing, lowering the incentives to use additive manufacturing in production. Moreover, there is a lack of standardization and suitable quality (mechanical and thermal properties) of materials. This issue must be solved with advances in materials science, expanding materials selection and thus lowering costs. While there has been significant progress in developing new materials, some industries require specific properties that are still challenging to replicate with AM. Not all metals and plastics can be temperature-
controlled enough for the conditions that AM requires. Most polymers used in AM cannot be recycled and those that can be suffer a potential quality loss.
8. **Intellectual Property Concerns:** As AM becomes more accessible, concerns about intellectual property theft and the potential for counterfeiting have grown. Pressing issues include protecting digital design files and enforcing intellectual property rights.
