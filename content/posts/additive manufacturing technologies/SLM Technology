* Introduction *

Metal 3D printing, also known as Metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) is a disruptive manufacturing technology that offers a whole new world of possibilities.It is a process that uses metal materials to build up parts and products, from a digital model, in layers. It can produce complex shapes that are difficult to achieve using conventional machining methods. Hence, it is true that in terms of offerings this technology not only offers new levels of design freedom but it is also about the sheer choice of metal materials that can be used with metal 3D printers.
Metal Additive Manufacturing opens a world of new applications and opportunities — 
One great example is in the transportation sector, where it can enable lightweight engineering and design techniques, which are becoming more important in efforts to reduce and redistribute a vehicle’s mass, in order to save energy during use, reduce manufacturing costs or improve the working performance.
In the medical and orthodontic sectors, it allows for the cost-effective production of customized products that are personalized and “tuned” to a patient’s individual needs — and this level of flexibility also points to the potential for use within the consumer goods market.
Metal Additive Manufacturing is being adopted by companies focused on innovation and creating new value. However, there are still some challenges that must be overcome — including education around applications, Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM), industry standards, regulations, certifications and metal materials quality — to accelerate its widespread adoption.


* How does metal 3D printing work? *

The basic fabrication process is similar for both SLM and DMLS. Here's how it works:
The build chamber is first filled with inert gas (for example argon) to minimize the oxidation of the metal powder and then it is heated to the optimal build temperature.
A thin layer of metal powder is spread over the build platform and a high-power laser scans the cross-section of the component, melting (or fusing) the metal particles together and creating the next layer. The entire area of the model is scanned, so the part is built fully solid.
When the scanning process is complete, the build platform moves downwards by one layer thickness and the recoater spreads another thin layer of metal powder. The process is repeated until the whole part is complete.
When the build process is finished, the parts are fully encapsulated in the metal powder. Unlike the polymer powder bed fusion process (such as SLS or MJF), the parts are attached to the build platform through support structures. Support in metal 3D printing is built using the same material as the part and is always required to mitigate the warping and distortion that may occur due to the high processing temperatures.
When the bin cools to room temperature, the excess powder is manually removed and the parts are typically heat treated while still attached to the build platform to relieve any residual stresses. Then the components are detached from the build plate via cutting, machining or wire EDM and are ready for use or further post-processing.

Like any other 3D printing process, SLM metal 3D printers need a CAD file as a blueprint for the desired part. The data set is cut into a number of layers by a slicer. Each layer forms a cross-section through the component. A layer thickness in 3D printing SLM usually varies between 20 and 60 micrometers. In the SLM 3D printing process, a squeegee spreads a layer of metal powder onto a lowerable build platform. A laser then scans the cross-section of the part and melts the powder in those areas. Because the powder cannot be compressed as densely as in SLS, the process relies on printed support structures in most cases. They serve to keep the components stable in the build space, to dissipate excess heat and to prevent deformation of the parts.


* Different Metal 3D printing technologies *

An important starting point is understanding the main Metal Additive Manufacturing technologies and processes, in order to define which is most suitable for a specific application. Further, the choice of the right technology and machine for your application completely depends on various factors, including specifications, budget, and product lifecycle.
Metal powder is the backbone of metal 3D printing. Though it is difficult and dangerous to handle in its raw state, its unique features make it the preferred metal stock type, hence, the vast majority of metal 3D printing technologies utilize metal powder.
There are a few different metal 3D printing technologies and these methods vary greatly, ranging from using high energy lasers to fuse loose powder to extruding bound metal powder filament. In this article, we will take a look at the most heavily used types of metal 3D printing:

1. **Powder Bed Fusion:** A common method that uses heat or light to fuse metal powder into layers, one on top of the other. Powder bed melting is currently the most common type of metal 3D printing. These machines distribute a fine layer of powder over a build plate and selectively melt a cross section of the part into the powder layer. There are distinct types of powder bed melting techniques based on the different ways of how they fuse the powder into metal parts: 
Selective Laser Melting: SLM is a type of rapid prototyping that uses a laser to selectively melt and fuse metallic powder material, layer by layer, to build a 3D part. It can produce geometrically complex parts,such as hollow, porous, or bonded structures, with great precision. They fit into a wide variety of applications: from dental/healthcare to aerospace. Build volumes range from very small (100mm cube) to large (800mm x 500mm x 400mm) and print speed is moderate. Precision of these machines is determined by laser beam width and layer height. 
While these machines are groundbreaking, a wide variety of facility and post processing requirements limit these machines to industrial users. SLM machines require trained professionals to operate them. Because of its intricate process, many parts need to be printed and tweaked a few times to yield results. Yet, the majority of Powder Bed Fusion machines are Selective Laser Melting (SLM) machines and it is the current standard for metal printing -- most companies in Metal AM today sell SLM machines.
Direct metal laser sintering (DMLS): DMLS is another type of 3D printing technology that uses a laser to fuse together metal powder layer by layer. DMLS can create complex geometries, such as internal channels, lattices, and complex surface textures. It can be used for prototypes, low-volume parts, and end-use parts but unlike SLM, DMLS can be used with metals that have a high melting point, such as stainless steel and cobalt chrome. Also, DMLS offers a higher build rate than SLM, making it ideal for large-scale production runs. Perhaps the most significant limitation is the initial cost of the machines and materials.


1. Electron Beam Melting: EBM machines use an electron beam instead of a laser to fabricate parts. GE Additive is the only company producing EBM machines. The electron beam yields a less precise part than SLM, but the process as a whole is faster for larger parts. These machines have almost all of the same constraints, costs, and issues as SLM machines, but are used more heavily in aerospace and medical applications than anywhere else. Similarly to SLM, EBM machines cost upwards of 1M to set up and require a dedicated technician to run.


2. Direct Energy Deposition: A method that uses a laser or electron beam to melt metal feedstock (which can be powder, called Powder DED or wire, called Wire DED) as it is deposited onto a build platform. Unlike powder bed fusion, instead of spreading powder on a bed and melting it with a laser, DED machines precisely blow powder out of a print head, using an on-head laser to fuse it to the part in construction. So, the stock and the laser both sit on a single print head that dispenses and fuses material simultaneously. The resultant parts are very similar to Powder Bed Fusion, with a few key differences and opportunities like DED machines can produce dense parts as they can work with high material deposition rates.

Binder Jetting: A process that uses a print head to deposit a liquid binding agent onto a thin layer of powder particles. The technology behind metal binder jetting reflects what a conventional (2D) printer uses to quickly jet ink onto paper. First, a binder jetting machine evenly distributes metal powder over its print bed, forming an unbound layer. Then, a jetting head much like one in a 2D printer distributes binding polymer in the shape of the part cross section, loosely adhering the powder. The process repeats until the machine yields a finished build of completed parts.
Parts printed on Binder Jetting machines require a post processing step called “sintering” to become fully metallic. In this process, the printed part is heated in an oven to just below its melting temperature. The binding material burns away and the metal powder unites into a full metal part. This process can be done in batches, meaning that it doesn’t significantly affect throughput.
Binder Jetting is a large-scale, high fidelity method of metal 3D printing that may replace SLM as the premier loose powder based method of 3D printing as Binder Jetting holds two main advantages over Selective Laser Melting. First, machines can print much faster by using multiple heads to jet in several places simultaneously. Second, the machine can make tens or even hundreds of the same part in one build. These parts can be sintered in a large furnace to achieve a manageable batch production infrastructure. As a result Binder Jetting is significantly faster on a per part basis than any other type of metal printing. Due to its speed and scalability, it may be the technology that propels metal additive manufacturing capabilities into production volumes but with this speed (and powder management requirements) comes massive costs -- currently, the only machines in this space cost well over a million dollars.

Vacuum furnaces are usually massive, industrial grade machines.

Bound Powder Extrusion: A method that uses waxy polymers to bind metal powder together, so the powder isn't lost. Bound Powder Extrusion (BPE) is an exciting newcomer to the metal additive manufacturing space. Unlike almost every other major 3D printing process, BPE machines do not use loose metal powder. Instead, the powder is bound together in waxy polymers in the same way that metal injection molding stock is created. The result is a material that’s much safer and easier to use than loose powder: bound powder extrusion material can be handled by hand and does not require the safety measures that loose powder machines do. BPE filament is extruded out of a nozzle in a manner very similar to standard FDM 3D printing, yielding a “green” part that contains metal powder evenly distributed in waxy polymer. 
After printing, BPE has two post processing steps: first, the polymer is mostly dissolved in a “wash” machine; second the washed part is sintered in an oven (similar to binder jetting). During the sintering process, the part shrinks to account for the space opened up by the dissolved binder, yielding a fully metallic part. Parts printed on BPE systems still often require post-processing -- heat treatment for parts that need advanced properties (though this is required for every metal), and post machining/polishing for enhanced surface finishes -- but there’s no powder management and reduced facility requirements.
As a filament based printing process, the part constraints of BPE parts closely mirror those of conventional FDM plastic printing: it works well for almost all part geometries, and can print with open cell infill. BPE machines leverage a simpler process to be much more affordable than all other major types of metal 3D printing, with machines costing between $120,000 and $200,000.

SLM Overview
Compared to the SLA, FDM or SLS processes, which were all patented towards the end of the 1980s, selective laser melting emerged somewhat later. The first notable successes were announced in 1995 by the Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology in Aachen. In cooperation with the company F&S Stereolithografietechnik GmbH, the SLM 3D printing process was developed. The company split in the early 2000s into Realizer GmbH, which today belongs to DMG Mori AG, and SLM Solutions AG, which is still one of the leading suppliers for SLM metal 3D printing.

SLM Materials
Selective laser melting is used to process metals. The development of new materials is a continuously advancing field of research, and new suppliers or established companies are constantly entering the market with a greater variety of materials. The most established materials for SLM 3D printing include aluminum (AlSi10Mg), stainless steel (1.2709 & 1.4404) and titanium (Ti6Al4V).
SLM Applications
SLM technology is well-suited for various applications across different industries. Many industries like aerospace, automotive engineering, dental and medical technology, and mechanical engineering, benefit from selective laser melting as an additive manufacturing technology. The technology is used in particular for rapid prototyping, but small series can now also be economically produced using SLM metal 3D printing. The high precision, small feature size, and excellent mechanical properties of SLM make it ideal for consolidating assemblies into one part, weight reduction, complex cooling channels, freeform shapes, rapid turnaround, and fabricating lightweight, optimized and custom components across sectors. Here are some typical applications:
Aerospace – Turbine blades, structural brackets, rocket nozzles
Automotive – Lightweighting parts, custom tooling
Medical – Orthopedic implants, prosthetics, surgical instruments
Industrial – Heat exchangers, fluid handling parts
Defense – Components for firearms, armor
Jewelry – Customized precious metal jewelry


SLM Advantages and Limitations
Like the vast majority of 3D printing technologies, selective laser melting also brings with it a great deal of geometric freedom. This means that highly complex geometries and bionic lightweight construction projects can be implemented without tools. Assembly consolidation is another advantage of SLM and also other 3D printing technologies. This involves bringing together individual assemblies and printing them directly in one piece to reduce material and labor and assembly costs. But it’s not just the geometric freedom of the technology that makes exciting components possible. The component properties themselves can also be improved by the SLM process. For example, the components are characterized by a particularly high density and almost pore-free surfaces.
But, like any technology, SLM has both advantages and limitations to consider:
Advantages
High dimensional accuracy and fine surface finish
Excellent mechanical properties maintained throughout builds
Complex geometries and lightweight structures possible
Consolidated parts and assemblies
Rapid turnaround for design iterations
Customized shapes, features, and designs
Limitations
Small build envelopes restrict part sizes
Relatively slow production rates
Supports limited materials – mostly metals
Significant post-processing often required
Residual stresses can cause deformation
High equipment and material costs
Understand application requirements and compare process tradeoffs to determine if SLM is the most suitable AM process. SLM provides a versatile tool for metal part production but requires experience to optimize applications.
Conclusion
SLM provides transformative capabilities for dense, high-performance metal part production. Understanding the different equipment types, working principles, specifications, applications, and advantages allows the technology to be leveraged effectively. With continual advances in machines, materials, software, and process control, SLM promises to become even more competitive against conventional manufacturing.
