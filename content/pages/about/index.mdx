Hi!

I am Sanya. I ensure that every delivery that goes out to the customer is perfect! And my aim is not just to achieve perfection but go beyond it to understand the problems of my customers and provide value addition so that they can realize opportunities that are invisible to themselves. This role is commonly known as “ Delivery Excellence Partner”.

Having worked in the field of quality and excellence for a year now it is imbibed in me as a habit to try to achieve excellence in whatever I do. Thus, I dream of establishing a culture of excellence. I wish that the organizations recognize that inculcating a culture of continuous improvement  has become the needs of the hour and the way to realize this skill is establishing a Centre of Excellence.

On the personal front, I am an introvert who likes to spend most of her time - dancing, cooking, binge-eating while binge-watching and trying many DIY crafts. I have a long list of books that I have committed to finish but that is a toughie because I am not a bibliophile. I adore natural beauty so I have tried my hands in gardening as well but very soon realized it is not my cup of tea. ;) So that is what I usually do in my spare time.

This is all about me for now. Stay tuned for some more interesting talks.
